Transform this GitHub repo from Java to Kotlin as a startup https://github.com/Gnzlt/NavigationView-Demo

I am trying to cut my way into Kotlin by making a fully fragments based application with its main page as a TabView that incorporates 3 tabs and in each tab there will be a RecyclerView and its adapter will be a firestore adapter.

Any help will be appreciated.
