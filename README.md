# com.startup

Transformed this GitHub repo from Java to Kotlin as a startup https://github.com/Gnzlt/NavigationView-Demo

I am trying to cut my way into Kotlin by making a fully fragments based application with its main page as a TabView that incorporates 3 tabs and in each tab there will be a RecyclerView and its adapter will be a firestore adapter.


I found this repository for davidevaliante in Kotlin ( https://github.com/davidevaliante/PowerChat)  that incorporates recyclerviews and firestore adapters in fragments in a simple well organized way. It'll help get the work start.

Any help will be appreciated.
